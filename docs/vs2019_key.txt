Installation :
• If the installer does not have access to the Internet, then install the studio's certificates into the system by executing Certificates_Setup.cmd ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATOR (once in the life of the system is enough). If at the time of launching the studio installer there is neither Internet access nor certificates installed in the system, then the studio installer can simply quietly close without explaining the essence of the problem to you
• Finally, run the studio installer by executing Setup_<Edt>.cmd, where <Edt> is the studio edition. Community contains enough features for normal comfortable programming and is free (although after 30 days it will require you to log into your microsoft account). Professional and Enterprise contain more features and even more features, respectively, and do not require a microsoft account (if you enter the key). Studio plugins are installed on the Community, Professional and Enterprise editions (the previous Express edition, which did not support plugins, is no longer released). In the BuildTools edition - only build tools (there is no IDE).
